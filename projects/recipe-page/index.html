            <li>
                To a saucepan over medium heat, add the condensed milk,
                butter, cocoa powder, and heavy cream. Cook, stirring 
                constantly, until the butter is melted and the mixture
                is smooth and glossy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lower the heat and stir in the  chopped chocolate,
                vanilla extract, and salt until fully melted and
                combined. Remove from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, add in the chopped tea biscuits 
                and walnuts, pour the chocolate mix over,and use 
                a rubber spatula to fold gently until everything
                is evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the mixture evenly between two pieces of
                plastic wrap. Shape each portion into a log,
                then roll tightly to seal.
            </li>
            <li>
                Refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours. Unwrap,
                dust the logs generously with powdered sugar,
                then slice and serve.
